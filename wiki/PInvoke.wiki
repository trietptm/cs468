#summary Some info I've found useful for dealing with pinvoke and marshalling structs

= Possible solutions handle WSABUF =
  * Defining custom struct for pinvoke [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc163910.aspx]
  * MSDN Calling Native Functions from Managed Code [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms235282.aspx]
  * Walking memory by hand of returned structs [http://www.netomatix.com/development/EmbedStruct.aspx]

=== Old ideas ===
    * Can just use IntPtr as any pointer then Marshal.PtrToStructure - [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/4ca6d5z7.aspx]
