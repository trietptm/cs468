Tried to put memory breakpoints on the buffers used to see if the data is later decrypted.  Never was able to get memory BPs to actually trigger.  I think this may be because I am trying to create the BPs when I'm inside of the send/recv code which is in ws2_32.dll and not the process we are monitoring.  Not sure how to fix this.

Tried HW breakpoints but just registering a callback cause the HW BP to trigger all the time and lock the program up.

==Enable Logging with PyDbg==
 * If you want to enable the PyDbg logging, change line 144 of pydbg.py to use sys.stderr.write() instead of None.  This requires a reinstall w/ setup.py (or you could just change it in python26/lib/site-packages/pydbg)
